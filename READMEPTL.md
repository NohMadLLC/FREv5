## Overview

The Principle of Temporal Lensing (PTL) is the world’s first empirically-locked, adversarially peer-reviewed mathematical model for quantifying subjective time distortion under trauma, emotion, and recursion. All parameters are scientifically grounded—no runtime fitting, no free variables. PTL integrates fractional memory decay, phenotype-specific neural entropy, narrative coherence, and nonparametric fallback protocols to ensure the model is universally valid, falsifiable, and immune to circularity.

## How to Use

1. **For Scientific Reviewers/Collaborators:**
   - Open `PTL WHITE PAPER BROWN.pdf` for the full empirical framework and methodology.
   - Use `PTL WHITE PAPER BROWN.tex` + `ptl_refs.bib` to make edits or prepare journal submissions on Overleaf.
   - Embed `ptl_diagram_example.png` in presentations, proposals, or talks.

2. **For Investors/Stakeholders:**
   - Read the Abstract and Section 2 of the PDF for the core innovation and impact.
   - See the diagram for a one-glance summary of model structure and workflow.
   - Contact NohMad LLC for licensing or technical partnership.

3. **For Developers/Data Scientists:**
   - All model parameters are locked to empirical data; code or statistical notebooks should reference the white paper for input requirements and validation steps.
   - No “tuning” or parameter guessing permitted—strictly follow the empirical protocols.
